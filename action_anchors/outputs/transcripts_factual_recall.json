However, the question is about the main ingredient in the soup, not the miso paste itself. So the soup typically includes miso as the base, but what else? Common ingredients in miso soup are dashi (a broth made from kelp and bonito flakes), tofu, seaweed, and green onions. But the main ingredient would be the miso, right? Wait, maybe the user is confused because the soup is called miso soup, but the main ingredient might be the dashi. Hmm. Let me verify. A quick check in my knowledge base: traditional miso soup is made by dissolving miso paste into a broth, which is usually dashi. So the main ingredient is the miso paste, but the broth is also a key component. However, the question specifies the main ingredient. Since the soup is named after the miso, it's likely that the answer is miso. But I should make sure. Maybe the user is looking for the primary component of the soup, which could be the dashi.

I know that rocks are generally classified into three main types: igneous, sedimentary, and metamorphic.

Limestone is a sedimentary rock, but when it undergoes metamorphism\u2014meaning it's subjected to heat and pressure\u2014it transforms into marble. So, marble should be a metamorphic rock. But wait, let me make sure I'm not confusing it with something else. \n\nI think another way to check is to consider the characteristics of marble. It's known for being a metamorphic rock that's used in construction and sculpture. It has a granular texture and often has veins of different colors. These features are typical of metamorphic rocks, which are formed from existing rocks that have been altered by heat and pressure. \n\nBut maybe I should verify this. If I'm unsure, using the web_search function would be a good idea. Let me search for \"What type of rock is marble?\" to confirm. The search should show that marble is indeed a metamorphic rock formed from limestone. \n\nAlternatively, I can think of other examples. For instance, slate is a metamorphic rock formed from shale, and quartzite comes from sandstone. So, following that pattern, marble from limestone fits into metamorphic. \n\nI think I'm confident enough to answer without the search, but if there's any doubt, the search would resolve it.
